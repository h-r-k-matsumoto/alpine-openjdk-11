## important
There are people who still use this docker image.  
I recommend using image of alpine tag of [AdoptOpenJDK](https://hub.docker.com/r/adoptopenjdk/openjdk11/tags/).  
It is not musl base, but it is lightweight.  

Thank you for reading.

# Result

The size of 1 GB has been reduced to about 85 MB.
Image size is the result output by the `docker images` command.

# Background problem
The docker image of openjdk 11 is published in the official respoitory of docker hub.
https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk/

This image has the following problem.

- `openjdk:11-jdk` tag image size is large. There is about 1 GB.
- Even if you use jlink, image size is 400 MB.
- Java Flight Recorder does not work in `jre` tag images.

The file size was confirmed with the following command.

```
$ sudo docker images |grep jdk
docker.io/openjdk                            11-jdk   f684efd78557  2 weeks ago         979 MB
$
```

I confirmed that libjvm.so becomes larger when using jlink.

```
$ docker run -it --rm openjdk:11-jdk /bin/sh
# ls -l /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/lib/server/
total 34944
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     1322 Jul 27 03:41 Xusage.txt

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 424362808 Aug 14 09:41 libjvm.so

```

The generated libjvm.so increased to 424 MB.
This problem is probably part of the following issue issue.
